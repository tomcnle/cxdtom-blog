title: Is My Product Ready for Market?
published: false
---

I found myself in a situation today where I was wondering if my product was ready to start selling. This is a widely debated topic with opinions varying from "if you weren't embarassed by your first product you shipped to late" to "you've now got to create a Minimum Loveable Product".

The problem lying in that if you sell a working product too early, you underwhelm a market - if you sell too late, you risk building something that no one wants.

Now, like everyone, I've found the short one liners banted about helpful in spirit but as per all one liners, not very practical. So I tried to apply my own hammer/nail view to it via my hammer, customer experience design.

In that relm, I'd be comfortable launching an experience if it met a goal for a user as well as that users must-meet needs.
